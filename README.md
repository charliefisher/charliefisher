### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 4A Mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I have a strong interest in software. I enjoy this type of work as it challenges me to find an elegant and efficient solution and allows me to quickly see the outcome of my work. I am a hard worker and quick learner and am eager to apply my skills to engineering problems.

You can see my work experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlierfisher/).
