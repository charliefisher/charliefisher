### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Mechatronics & Algorithms Engineer. I have a strong interest in high performance software. I especially enjoy writing software that simulates or interacts with the real world. I am a hard worker and quick learner and am eager to apply my skills to engineering problems.

You can see my work experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlierfisher/).
